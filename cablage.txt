The SD Slot/Socket is expected to be wired as follows, see stm32f4_discovery.c => SD_LowLevel_Init(
 
CARDDETECT = PC2 (Retargetable)
CLK = PC12
CMD = PD2
D0 = PC8
D1 = PC9
D2 = PC10
D3 = PC11
VDD = 3V
VSS = GND
 
PC10 (SCLK) and PC12 (SDIN) potentially conflict with the CS43L22
 
The CMD, D0, D1, D2, D3 pins should have 33K or 47K pull up resistors.
